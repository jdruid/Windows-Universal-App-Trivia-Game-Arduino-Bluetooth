Windows-Universal-App-Trivia-Game-Arduino-Bluetooth
===================================================

I decided to take on a project that involves creating a Windows Universal App that communicates to an Arduino device via Bluetooth. I found a blog post (thanks Channel 9) and used the Arduino Sketch to get going but modified it to include 2-way communication. The sketch accepts input from the Windows device but also sends data based on push buttons.
